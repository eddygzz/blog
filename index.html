		<p class="blue-text"> We have been learning a lot of farming systems through the agriculture module and it has really challenged me as an upcoming urban farmer. Although we have limited space here in the Bronx, the techniques such F&D, aquaponics, kratky method, and others methods that allow farmers to grow varieties of plants and fruits. Since day 1, the goal has been how can we feed and empower the community to demand access to quality green in urban areas; this course does not get as ready for the real world but it is also teaching us valuable skills to open and help space in existence the Bronx. lastly, we have been spending a lot of time understanding how to plan your farm, how to take care of the farm, and how to avoid pest in our growing area. All these skills are teaching us important information to keep in mind when are operating our future sites. Planning takes time and without it the chances of failing is high. </p>

		<p class= "black-text"> They say that one need up to 10,000 hours to full master a new skill and to be quite honest coding is a foreign language- To be quiet honest, I have not been dedicating time to coding and that shows on my current situation and ways to further the materials at hand, They say practice makes you better so I need to find time. Besides the stuggles I have seen some success with HTML, which is very easy to understand but CSS and Java Script are different ball parks, but again its about time and how it clicks. I am trying my best to make sure that I can combine everything we done so far into a website that help find food, clothing, other resources uses for the community. </p>

		<p class= "brown-text"> Osha module- hmm, I dont even know where to start haha but the program is very helpful in understanding what is at stack when one signs up to work at a site. Some might think its all about the worker but there needs to joint effort put togher by both entities- employee and employers to make sure everyone is safe at work. The course has been very helpful in showcasing the dangers on site and ways to avoid certain scenarios. Work injuries will always happen but knowing your rights as a worker, paying attention to details, and wearing the appropriate PPE can save millions of workers in the country. In the past few weeks, I have learnt that one must always pay attention to his or her surrounding to avoid any issues. </p>

		<p class= "orange-text"> I have only had the chance to attend one of our sunday in person sessions- my first was ok, mosquitos were eating my legs up haha, but Will has there to provide me some pants which helped out throught the afternoon. I really like the bonding environment, everyone is sharing kwoledge and experiences with each other while learning new skills. In my opinion, that is the best way to learn new things and retail imformation .</p>
